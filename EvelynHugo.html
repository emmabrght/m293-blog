                            <p>Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth
                                about
                                her
                                glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique
                                Grant
                                for
                                the
                                job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? <br> <br>

                                Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her
                                professional
                                life
                                is
                                going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique
                                is
                                determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career. <br> <br>

                                Summoned to Evelyn’s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress
                                tells
                                her
                                story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show
                                business in
                                the
                                ‘80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of
                                ruthless
                                ambition,
                                unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real
                                connection
                                to
                                the legendary star, but as Evelyn’s story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her
                                life
                                intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.</p>
