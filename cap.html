                                <p>Author name: Fyodor Dostoevsky<br>
                                    Published on: January 1, 1866 <br>
                                    Pages: 671 <br>
                                    Rating: 4.5/5 <br>

                            <p>Raskolnikov, a destitute and desperate former student, wanders through the slums of St
                                Petersburg and commits a random murder without remorse or regret. He imagines himself to
                                be a great man, a Napoleon: acting for a higher purpose beyond conventional moral law.
                                But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a suspicious police
                                investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds
                                the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck. Only Sonya, a downtrodden sex
                                worker, can offer the chance of redemption.
