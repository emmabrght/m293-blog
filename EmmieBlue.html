                            <p>At sixteen, Emmie Blue stood in the fields of her school and released a red balloon into
                                the sky. Attached was her name, her email address… and a secret she desperately wanted
                                to be free of. Weeks later, on a beach in France, Lucas Moreau discovered the balloon
                                and immediately emailed the attached address, sparking an intense friendship between the
                                two teens. <br> <br>

                                Now, fourteen years later, Emmie is hiding the fact that she’s desperately in love with
                                Lucas. She has pinned all her hopes on him and waits patiently for him to finally admit
                                that she’s the one for him. So dedicated to her love for Lucas, Emmie has all but
                                neglected her life outside of this relationship—she’s given up the search for her
                                absentee father, no longer tries to build bridges with her distant mother, and lives as
                                a lodger to an old lady she barely knows after being laid off. And when Lucas tells
                                Emmie he has a big question to ask her, she’s convinced this is the moment he’ll reveal
                                his feelings for her. But nothing in life ever quite goes as planned, does it?
