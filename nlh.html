                            <p>The poignant and fascinating story of a young man who is caught between the breakup of
                                the traditions of a northern Japanese aristocratic family and the impact of Western
                                ideas. <br> <br>

                                Portraying himself as a failure, the protagonist of Osamu Dazai's No Longer Human
                                narrates a seemingly normal life even while he feels himself incapable of understanding
                                human beings. Oba Yozo's attempts to reconcile himself to the world around him begin in
                                early childhood, continue through high school, where he becomes a "clown" to mask his
                                alienation, and eventually lead to a failed suicide attempt as an adult. Without
                                sentimentality, he records the casual cruelties of life and its fleeting moments of
                                human connection and tenderness.
