                            <p> Rowan has gone rogue, and has taken it upon himself to put the Scythedom through a trial
                                by fire. Literally. In the year since Winter Conclave, he has gone off-grid, and has
                                been striking out against corrupt scythes—not only in MidMerica, but across the entire
                                continent. He is a dark folk hero now—“Scythe Lucifer”—a vigilante taking down corrupt
                                scythes in flames. <br> <br>

                                Citra, now a junior scythe under Scythe Curie, sees the corruption and wants to help
                                change it from the inside out, but is thwarted at every turn, and threatened by the “new
                                order” scythes. Realizing she cannot do this alone—or even with the help of Scythe Curie
                                and Faraday, she does the unthinkable, and risks being “deadish” so she can communicate
                                with the Thunderhead—the only being on earth wise enough to solve the dire problems of a
                                perfect world. But will it help solve those problems, or simply watch as perfection goes
                                into decline?
